      not exist in the cart's sales channel, it cannot be added to the cart. If
      you add a publishable API key in the header of this request and specify a
      sales channel ID, the specified sales channel must be within the scope of
      the publishable API key's resources. If you add a publishable API key in
      the header of this request, you don't specify a sales channel ID, and the
      publishable API key is associated with one sales channel, that sales
      channel will be attached to the cart. If no sales channel is passed and no
      publishable API key header is passed or the publishable API key isn't
      associated with any sales channel, the cart will not be associated with
      any sales channel.
