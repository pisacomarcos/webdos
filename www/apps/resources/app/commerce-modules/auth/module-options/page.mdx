In this document, you'll learn about the options of the Auth Module.

## providers

The `providers` option is an array of auth provider modules.

When the Medusa application starts, these providers are registered and can be used to handle authentication.

For example:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
const { Modules } = require("@medusajs/modules-sdk")

const modules = {
  // ...
  [Module.AUTH]: {
    resolve: "@medusajs/auth",
    options: {
      providers: [
        {
          resolve: "@medusajs/auth-google",
          options: {
            config: {
              google: {
                // provider options...
              }
            }
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

The `providers` option is an array of objects that accept the following properties:

- `resolve`: A string indicating the package name of the auth provider module or the path to it.
- `options`: An optional object of the auth provider module's options. The object must have the following property:
  - `config`: An object whose key is the ID of the auth provider, and its value is an object of options to pass to the provider module.

## Auth CORS

The Medusa application's authentication API routes are defined under the `/auth` prefix that requires setting the `authCors` property of the `http` configuration. So, before using these routes, make sure to set that configuration.

Refer to [Medusa's configuration guide](/references/medusa-config#authCors) for more details.

## authMethodsPerActor Configuration

The Medusa application's configuration accept an `authMethodsPerActor` configuration which restricts the allowed auth providers used with an actor type.

Learn more about the `authMethodsPerActor` configuration in [this guide](../auth-providers/page.mdx#configure-allowed-auth-providers-of-actor-types).
