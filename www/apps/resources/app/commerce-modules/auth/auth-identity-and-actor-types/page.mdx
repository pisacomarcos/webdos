In this document, you’ll learn about concepts related to identity and actors in the Auth Module.

## What is an Auth Identity?

The [AuthIdentity data model](/references/auth/model/AuthIdentity) represents a previously-authenticated user.

When a user is authenticated, a record of `AuthIdentity` is created. This record is used to validate the user’s authentication in future requests.

## Actor Types

An actor type is a type of user that can be authenticated. This user is a record of a data model defined by a module.

For example, the `customer` belongs to the Customer Module’s `Customer` data model. Similarly, the `user` belongs to the User Module’s `User` data model.

### Protect Routes by Actor Type

When you protect routes with the `authenticate` middleware, you specify in its first parameter the actor type that must be authenticated to access the specified API routes.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["8", `"user"`, "The actor type that must be authenticated to access the specified routes."]
]

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts" highlights={highlights}
import { MiddlewaresConfig, authenticate } from "@medusajs/medusa"

export const config: MiddlewaresConfig = {
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/custom/admin*",
      middlewares: [
        authenticate("user", ["session", "bearer", "api-key"]),
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

By specifying `user` as the first parameter of `authenticate`, only authenticated users of actor type `user` can access API routes starting with `/custom/admin`.

## Custom Actor Types

You can define custom actor types that point to the data model of your module.

For example, if you have a custom module with a `Manager` data model, you can authenticate managers with the `manager` actor type.

Learn how to create a custom actor type in [this guide](../create-actor-type/page.mdx).
