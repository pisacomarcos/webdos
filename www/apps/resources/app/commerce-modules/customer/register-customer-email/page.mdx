In this guide, you'll learn the steps to register and authenticate a customer.

<Note title="Steps Summary">

1. Send a `POST` request to `/auth/customer/emailpass`.
2. Send a request to the [Create Customer API route](!api!/store#customers_postcustomers) passing the token obtained from the first step as a bearer token.
3. Send a `POST` request to `/auth/customer/emailpass` to log-in.

</Note>

## 1. Obtain Authentication Token

Before registering and creating the customer, you must create an authentication identity that's associated with that customer.

To do that, use the `/auth/customer/{provider}` API route, where `{provider}` is the auth provider to use to handle authentication.

<Note>

Learn more about the `/auth` route in [this document](../../auth/authentication-route/page.mdx)

</Note>

For example, send a `POST` request to `/auth/customer/emailpass`:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/auth/customer/emailpass' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "customer@gmail.com",
    "password": "supersecret"
}'
```

## 2. Register Customer

Then, use the returned token in the header of the [Create Customer API route](!api!/store#customers_postcustomers):

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/store/customers' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
--data-raw '{
  "email": "customer@gmail.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}'
```

This creates and returns the customer.

## 3. Login Customer

Finally, to log-in the customer, send a `POST` request again to `/auth/customer/emailpass`:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/auth/customer/emailpass' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "customer@gmail.com",
    "password": "supersecret"
}'
```

You can now use the returned token to send authenticated requests as a customer.
