This recipe provides the general steps to build personalized products in Medusa.

## Overview

Personalized products are products that customers can customize based on their need. For example, they can upload an image to print on a shirt or provide a message to include in a letter.

In Medusa, you create a custom module defining data models, implementing custom features, and creating relationships to other modules' data models.

You also have freedom in how you choose to implement the storefront, allowing you to build a unique experience around your products.

## Store Personalized Data

The Cart Module's `LineItem` data model has a `metadata` field that holds any custom data. You can pass the customer's customization in that field when adding a product to the cart.

For example, if you’re asking customers to enter a message to put in a letter they’re purchasing, use the `metadata` attribute of the `LineItem` data model to set the personalized information entered by the customer:

```bash
curl -X POST '{backend_url}/store/carts/{id}/line-items' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "variant_id": "variant_123",
  "quantity": 1,
  "metadata": {
    "message": "Hello, World!"
  }
}'
```

<Note>

Two line items in the cart having different `metadata` attributes are not considered the same item. So, each line item is managed separately and can have its own quantity.

</Note>

In more complex cases, you can create a custom module that stores and manages the personalization data models. You can also create a relationship between these data models and the `LineItem` data model.

## Build a Custom Storefront

Due to Medusa's modular architecture, there are no restrictions on the framework you use to build the storefront, or design and experience you provide customers. The storefront connects to the Medusa application using the Store API Routes.

You can build a unique experience around your products that focuses on the customer’s personalization capabilities.

Medusa provides a Next.js Starter storefront with basic ecommerce functionalities that can be customized. You can also build your own storefront and use Medusa’s client libraries or Store API Routes to communicate with the Medusa application.

  {
    href: "/nextjs-starter",

    startIcon: <NextJs />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },

    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
]} />

## Pass Personalized Data to the Order

If you store the personalized data using a custom module:

- Create a custom API Route that handles saving the personalization data.
- Call that API Route from the storefront after adding the item to the cart.
- Listen to the `order.created` event to attach the personalized data to the Order Module's `LineItem` data model.

<Note type="soon">

The `order.created` event is currently not emitted.

## Fulfill Personalized Products in Orders

To fulfill your personalized products with a third-party service or custom logic, create a fulfillment provider module.

The Fulfillment Module registers your fulfillment provider module to use it to fulfill orders.

  title="Create a Fulfillment Service"

  startIcon={<AcademicCapSolid />}
