This recipe provides the general steps to build subscription-based purchase with Medusa.

## Overview

Subscription-based purchase allows customers to purchase products for a specified period, and the payment and fulfillment is processed within a regular interval in that period.

For example, a customer can purchase a book subscription box for a period of three months. Each month, the payment is captured for that order and, if the payment is successful, the fulfillment is processed.

## Save Subscription Details

Subscriptions have details related to the subscription interval, subscription period, and more.

To store the subscription details, create a data model in a module. The module's main service provides data management feature of the data model.

<CardList items={[
  {
    href: "!docs!/basics/modules-and-services",
    title: "Create a Module",
    text: "Learn how to create a module.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
  {
    href: "!docs!/basics/data-models",

    text: "Learn how to create a data model.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,

]} />

## Implement Subscription Approach

There are different ways to implement subscriptions in your Medusa application. This recipe provides two options: using Stripe subscriptions, or implementing subscriptions logic within the application, independent of a specific payment provider.

### Option 1: Using Stripe Subscriptions

Stripe provides a [subscription payments feature](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/overview) that allows you to authorize payment on a subscription basis within Stripe. Stripe then handles checking for recurring payments and capturing payment at the specified interval.

This approach allows you to delegate the complications of implementing the subscription logic to Stripe, but doesn't support using other payment providers.

Although Medusa provides a Stripe provider module, it doesn't handle subscriptions. You can create a custom Stripe Subscription payment module.

<Card
  href="/references/payment/provider"
  title="Create Payment Provider Module"
  text="Learn how to create a payment provider module."
  startIcon={<AcademicCapSolid />}
  showLinkIcon={false}
/>

### Option 2: Custom Subscription Logic

By implementing the subscription logic within your application, you have full control over the subscription logic. You'll also be independent of payment providers, providing customers with more than one payment provider.

Implementing the logic depends on your use case, but you'll mainly implement the following:

1. Create a subscriber that listens to the `order.created` event to save the subscription details or perform other actions.
2. Create a scheduled job that checks daily for subscriptions that need renewal.

<Note type="soon">

- The `order.created` event isn't emitted yet.
- Scheduled jobs are coming soon.

    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },

    title: "Create a Scheduled Job",
    text: "Learn how to create a scheduled job.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,

## Customize Admin

You can extend the admin to provide an interface to manage your custom features.

Extend the Medusa Admin to add widgets to existing pages or add new pages.

<CardList items={[
  {
    href: "!docs!/advanced-development/admin/widget",
    title: "Create Admin Widget",
    text: "Learn how to add widgets into existing admin pages.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
  {
    href: "!docs!/advanced-development/admin/ui-routes",
    title: "Create Admin UI Routes",
    text: "Learn how to add new pages to your Medusa Admin.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  }
]} />

## Build a Storefront

Medusa provides a Next.js Starter. Since you've customized your Medusa project, you must either customize the existing Next.js Starter, or create a custom storefront.

<CardList items={[
  {
    href: "/nextjs-starter",
    title: "Option 1: Use Next.js Starter",
    text: "Install the Next.js Starter to customize it.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
  {
    href: "!docs!/storefront-development/tips",
    title: "Option 2: Build Custom Storefront",
    text: "Find tips to build your own storefront.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  }
]} />
