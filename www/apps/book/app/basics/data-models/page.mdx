In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn what data models are and how to create a data model.

## What is a Data Model?

A data model is a class that represents a table in the database. A data model is created in a module. You can then create a service that manages that data model.

Data models are based on [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/quick-start). So, you can use its decorators, types, and utilities when creating a model.

## How to Create a Data Model

<Note title="Steps Summary">

1. Create data model class in a module.
2. Generate migration for the data model.
3. Add migration scripts to the module's definition.
4. Run migration to add table for data model in the database.

</Note>

A data model is a class created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under a module's `models` directory.

For example, create the file `src/modules/hello/models/my-custom.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/hello/models/my-custom.ts"
import { BaseEntity } from "@medusajs/utils"
import { 
  Entity, 
  PrimaryKey, 
  Property,
} from "@mikro-orm/core"

@Entity()
export class MyCustom extends BaseEntity {
  @PrimaryKey({ columnType: "text" })
  id!: string

  @Property({ columnType: "text" })
  name: string
}
```

This defines a new data model `MyCustom` with the fields `id` and `name`. Data models extend the `BaseEntity` class imported from `@medusajs/utils`.

### Create a Migration

After creating the data model, you must create a migration that creates a table in your database for this data model.

A migration is a class created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under a module's `migrations` directory. It implements an `up` and `down` method, where the `up` method reflects changes on the database, and the `down` method reverts the changes from the database.

<Details summaryContent="Generate with MikroORM">
  MikroORM provides a CLI tool that helps you generate migrations. To use it:

  1. Create the file `src/modules/hello/mikro-orm.config.dev.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts highlights={[["8", "hello", "The module's name."]]}
  import path from "path"
  import { TSMigrationGenerator } from "@medusajs/utils"
  import { MyCustom } from "./models/my-custom"

  module.exports = {
    entities: [MyCustom],
    schema: "public",
    clientUrl: "postgres://postgres@localhost/medusa-hello",
    type: "postgresql",
    migrations: {
      path: path.join(__dirname, "migrations"),
      generator: TSMigrationGenerator,
    },
  }
  ```

  2. Run the following command in the root directory of your Medusa application:

  ```bash
  npx cross-env MIKRO_ORM_CLI=./src/modules/hello/mikro-orm.config.dev.ts mikro-orm migration:create
  ```

  <Note title="Tip">

  Add this command as a script in `package.json` for easy usage in the future. Use this command whenever you want to generate a new migration in your module.

  </Note>

  After running the command, a new file is created under the `src/modules/hello/migrations` directory. This file holds `up` and `down` methods that define the actions to execute when running and reverting the migration respectively.
  
</Details>

For example:

```ts title="src/modules/migrations/Migration20240429090012.ts"
import { Migration } from "@mikro-orm/migrations"

export class Migration20240429090012 extends Migration {

  async up(): Promise<void> {
    this.addSql("create table if not exists \"my_custom\" (\"id\" varchar(255) not null, \"name\" text not null, constraint \"my_custom_pkey\" primary key (\"id\"));")
  }

  async down(): Promise<void> {
    this.addSql("drop table if exists \"my_custom\" cascade;")
  }

}
```

In the `up` method, you create the table `my_custom` and define its columns. In the `down` method, you drop the table.

<Note title="Tip">

The queries performed in each of the methods use PostgreSQL syntax.

</Note>

### Run Migration

To reflect the changes in the migration, run the `migration` command:

```bash npm2yarn
npx medusa migrations run
```

If ran successfully, the `my_custom` table will be created in the database.

## When to Use Data Models

<Note title="Use data models when" type="success">

- You want to store data related to your customization in the database.

</Note>

<Note title="Don't use data models if" type="error">

- You want to store simple key-value pairs related to an existing data model. Instead, use the `metadata` field that most existing models have, which is an object of custom key-value pairs.

</Note>
