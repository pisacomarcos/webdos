 * Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the Line Item API Routes part of the [Store Cart API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts).
 *
 * The hooks listed have general examples on how to use them, but it's highly recommended to use the {@link Providers.Cart.CartProvider | CartProvider} provider and
 * the {@link Providers.Cart.useCart | useCart} hook to manage your cart and access the current cart across your application.
